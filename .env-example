# Test Data
# A transaction hash for testing transaction-related methods
# Example: A contract deployment transaction or a transaction with L2 to L1 logs
# Current working example: 0x26bb434d058153168801f1f77ad870ab279e79d97d58b8b3fd9da0f2a64bcfb9
TEST_TX_HASH=0x26bb434d058153168801f1f77ad870ab279e79d97d58b8b3fd9da0f2a64bcfb9

# An address for testing account-related methods
# Example: An address that has sent transactions on the chain
# Current working example: 0x38711eC715A5A32180427792Dc0e97f8E3303071
TEST_ADDRESS=0x38711eC715A5A32180427792Dc0e97f8E3303071

# Block and Batch Numbers
# A specific L2 block number for testing block-related methods (instead of 'latest')
# Example: A recent block number from the chain
# Current working example: 203512
TEST_BLOCK_NUMBER=203512

# A specific L2 block hash for testing block-related methods
# Example: The hash of the block specified in TEST_BLOCK_NUMBER
TEST_BLOCK_HASH=0x...

# A specific L1 batch number for testing batch-related methods
# Example: A recent batch number from the chain (can be found in block details)
# Current working example: 849 (from zks_getBlockDetails result)
TEST_L1_BATCH_NUMBER=849

# Message Index for L2 to L1 proofs
# Example: 0 for the first message, 1 for the second, etc.
TEST_MESSAGE_INDEX=0

# Message Proof Parameters
# An address that has sent messages from L2 to L1 (required for zks_getL2ToL1MsgProof)
# Example: An address that has successfully sent messages from L2 to L1
# Current working example: Use the same as TEST_ADDRESS since it's active
